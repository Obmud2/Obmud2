- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Obmud2 / Jon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more languages and applying these to a commercial setting. I have recently been developing my knowledge in C++, and I am particularly interested in low-level applications where optimisation is important.

Some examples of my projects:
- C++ minesweeper, cipher solver and other small projects
- Data Science projects using R and Python
- Application of Navier Stokes
